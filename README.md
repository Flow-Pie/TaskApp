# TaskApp - Execution Flow Diagram / Call Graph

This repository contains detailed task management system diagrams in **Draw.io (.drawio)** and **SVG formats**. These diagrams provide a visual representation of the system's execution flow, making it easier to understand, debug, and optimize the codebase.

The diagrams illustrate the interactions between **actors (users)**, **functions**, and **classes** during program execution. They also depict the **control flow of function calls**, **dependency injection**, and the **lifetime of persistence services**.

## Key Benefits
- **Debugging Function Calls**: Easily trace and debug the sequence of function calls.
- **Codebase Comprehension**: Simplify the understanding of complex code structures.
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize performance through clear visual insights.
